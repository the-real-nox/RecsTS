For me security and privacy have always been big concern. I also want something that is not solely dependent on big tech companies, not only because of decentralization (I don't want to take the power over data out of your hands.), but also since the usage of e.g. Firebase would abstract many things (I still partially do this to learn).

## Preface
The idea of the whole auth-system came to my mind in October 2024. I've tried a couple of times and failed, every time, with every framework.
I see it as a possibility to learn more about OAuth2 and so on, since all frameworks add to much abstraction to really gain knowledge about inner workings. So I'm going to get my hands dirty and implement it in a bare-hand approach.
